## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme)

The QR Code Reader API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/qrcodereader](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/qrcodereader?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```javascript
const qrcodereaderAPI = require('@apiverve/qrcodereader');
const api = new qrcodereaderAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

---

## Usage

### File Upload

This API requires a file upload. Use `executeWithFile()` to upload files:

```javascript
// Upload a file (path, Buffer, or ReadStream)
api.executeWithFile('/path/to/file.image', options, callback);
```

**Accepted file types:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
**Maximum file size:** 10 MB

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
// This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/image.jpg';

api.executeWithFile(filePath, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
// This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/image.jpg';

api.executeWithFile(filePath)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    // This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/image.jpg';

    try {
        const data = await api.executeWithFile(filePath);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```
